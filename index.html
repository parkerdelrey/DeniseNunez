      <h1>Bronx Physician Calls for Cultural Sensitivity</h1>

    <p>
      Dr. Denise Nuñez, a Bronx physician, is passionate about providing health services that are accessible and culturally sensitive for Spanish-speakers.

      "They're illegal, they're hard workers, they're really nice people," said Dr. Nuñez. "So, for very low cost, we actually have them come here and they can get their physicals done and checked out."
    </p>

    <p>
      According to a Pew Research Center study, the greater New York metropolitan area had the largest population of undocumented immigrants in the U.S. in 2016.

    <script type="text/javascript">
      ! function() {
        "use strict";
        window.addEventListener("message", (function(a) {
          if (void 0 !== a.data["datawrapper-height"])
            for (var e in a.data["datawrapper-height"]) {
              var t = document.getElementById("datawrapper-chart-" + e) || document.querySelector("iframe[src*='" + e + "']");
              t && (t.style.height = a.data["datawrapper-height"][e] + "px")
            }
        }))
      }();
    </script>

    <p>
      "They need more doctors that look like [them] - more culturally sensitive doctors," said Dr. Nuñez. "They get very nervous and they think we're going to call the cops on them.”
    </p>

    <p>
      According to the CDC, COVID-19 hospitalizations for Hispanic or Latino persons are 4.6 times higher than their white counterparts. "The numbers say it," said Dr. Nuñez. "I saw it, I lived it because I was in the ICU all the time."
